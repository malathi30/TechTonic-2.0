This task was about creating a simple landing page section using only HTML and CSS. 
The goal was to understand how to structure a webpage properly and make it responsive without using any frameworks.

I created a “Why TechTonic” section using semantic tags like section, header, and article. I used Flexbox in CSS to align the content because it makes the layout adapt easily to different screen sizes.

From this task, I learned how semantic HTML improves readability and how Flexbox helps in building responsive designs. I also realized how small CSS changes can affect how a page looks on mobile and desktop.

One good thing about my solution is that the layout is clean and simple, and it works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

One thing that could be improved is the visual styling like colors and fonts. Getting the spacing right on smaller screens was a bit challenging.

Overall, this task helped me understand how to build a basic responsive landing section from scratch.
